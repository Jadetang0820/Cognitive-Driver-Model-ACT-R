# Cognitive-Driver-Model-ACT-R-
Driver model for predicting both lateral (steering) and longitudinal (speed) control performance of human drivers in teleoperating unmanned ground vehicles.(UGV)

In a teleoperation setting, a human driver remotely controls all actions taken by the vehicle. Significant communication delays may exist in teleoperated vehicles that are not present when the driver is on board. As a result, mobility performance may deteriorate. The goal of the project is to develop a computational model to predict human driver performance under various teleoperation conditions. Previous efforts have shown that the lateral control performance can be successfully captured using a cognitive architecture. Therefore, the current focus is to predict the longitudinal control performance of human teleoperators as a function of communication delays using the same cognitive architecture. Development of such a driver model would enable simulation-based studies of human performance in unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) teleoperation without requiring expensive human testing, thereby notably reducing the cost and time of analyses and accelerating the development of new vehicular technologies.
